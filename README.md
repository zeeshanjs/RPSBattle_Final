# Rock-Paper-Scissors Battle

## Overview
Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors Battle game! This project was created as part of Stanford University's Code in Place course. It aims to combine the basics of Python programming with graphics and animation, two areas I am particularly fond of.

## Features
- Classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game logic
- User-friendly graphical interface using `tkinter`
- Animated winner and draw announcements
- Custom graphics for the game splash screen and result indicators
- Score tracking over multiple rounds

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

You'll also need the following Python libraries:
- `tkinter`
- `PIL` (Pillow)

You can install Pillow using pip:
```sh
pip install pillow

```

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/zeeshanjs/RPSBattle_Final.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd RPSBattle_Final
   ```
3. Run the game:
   ```sh
   python RPS_Battle_Final_Project.py
   ```

## Gameplay
- Click the "START GAME" button to begin.
- Choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors by clicking the corresponding button.
- The game will display the choices and the result of each round.
- The first to reach the defined number of rounds wins the game.
- Enjoy the animated results!

## Project Structure
- `RPS_Battle_Final_Project.py`: Main game logic and interface.
- `Splash.png`: Custom splash screen graphic.
- `t2.png` and `hs2.png`: Custom result graphics for winning and drawing.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I learned:
- The basics of Python programming.
- How to use `tkinter` for creating graphical user interfaces.
- How to animate elements in a GUI using `tkinter` and Pillow.
- The importance of combining logic with creativity in coding.
